# Data source

Source: This data set is from Amrom E. Obstfeld, who de-identified data on
COVID-19 testing during 2020 at CHOP (Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Pennsylvania).

This data set contains data concerning testing for SARS-CoV2 via PCR as well as
associated metadata. The data has been anonymized, time-shifted, and permuted.

> Additionally, the dataset has been transformed so that it is not in the tidy
> format anymore.
