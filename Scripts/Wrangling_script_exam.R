Trying things for the codebook_exam dataset


1. Trying the delimeter separating data fields, but found out that it wasnt necessary for this dataset as the delimimiter is already set as tab
Exam_data <- read_delim(here("Data", "exam_data.txt"), delim = "\t")
Exam_data

2. tried to separate the first column with following code:
  
  Here I try to separate the first column into two subcaterogies:
  ```{r}
covid_data <-
  covid_data %>% 
  separate(col= subject,
           into = c ("PatientID", "Patient_Name"), separate = "-")

got an error. Needed to add the merge function to add values together

3. tried to cahnge the columns age_gender but suddely got 31048 observations wiht this function:
  clean_covid<-
  clean_covid %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "gender", values_to = "age", cols=15:16)
clean_covid

we created a duplicate number because of the "NA"
then added another filter funciton to remove the NAÂ´s in the age column

4. we tried different geom_plots to vizualize and analyse the waiting time over the 100 days.
